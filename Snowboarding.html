    <p>If you read my hobbies page then you already know that I love to snowboard,
      but I will tell you more about what I have been doing recently and explaining the snowboarding tricks I can do.<br>
    I love to go on the terrain parks and ride on rails and boxes. If you dont Know what a box is then here is my explainaion,
    a box is a metal cube that is polished at the top so that you an ride over the box wihout damaging your snowboard or your skis.<br>
    A rail is petty sel explanatory, it is a metal pipe that you ride on top of. <br>I also do a lot of jumps,
    the tricks that I can do on jumps are grabs and 180*s, a grab is when you grab on a certain part of the board,
    there are tons of grabs and i can do all of them except a rocket grab (you put both of your hands on the front of you board).<p>
