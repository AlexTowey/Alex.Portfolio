    <p>If you read my hobbies page then you already know that I love to snowboard,<br>
    but I will tell you more about what I have been doing recently and explaining the snowboarding tricks I can do.<br>
    I love to go on the terrain parks and ride on rails and boxes. <br>
    If you dont Know what a box is then here is my explainaion,<br>
    a box is a metal cube that is polished at the top so that you an ride over the box wihout damaging your snowboard or your skis.<br>
    A rail is petty self explanatory, it is a metal pipe that you ride on top of. <br>
    I also do a lot of jumps, the tricks that I can do on jumps are grabs and 180s, I am srill tryin to land a 360<br>
    a grab is when you grab on a certain part of the board. There are tons of grabs, and I can do most of them.<p>
