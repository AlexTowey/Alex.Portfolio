        lots of middle school matches, <br>many 9th grade matches,
        1 JV match, and one Varsity match in my second year! <br>(thats pretty good for a two year wrestler)</p>

      <h3>Ripsticking, and Skateboarding</h3>     
        <p>   I like to ripsrick and skateboard in the summer when I cant snowboard. <br>If you dont know what ripsticking is,
        it is a shaped board that can curve by shifting your feet position, <br>and you ride on it with two wheels. </p>
