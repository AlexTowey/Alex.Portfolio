        <p>I love wrestling and it is my favorite sport I have been wrestling for two years and I have been wrestling 
        lots of middle school matches, many 9th grade matches,
        1 JV match, and one Varsity match in my second year! (thats pretty good for a two year wrestler)</p>

        <p>I love snowboarding and I just recently went on a trip to vermont to snowboard at killington mountain.
        I have been snowboarding since I was about 9 and a half so I have been snowboarding for 4 years.</p>
      <h3>Ripsticking, and Skateboarding</h3>     
        <p>I like to ripsrick and skateboard in the summer when I cant snowboard. If you dont know what ripsticking is,
        it is a shaped board that can curve by shifting your feet position and you ride on it with two wheels. </p>
